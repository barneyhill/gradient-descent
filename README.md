# Physical Gradient Descent
Execute gradient descent on a terrain function of the world!
## Overview
With the aim of developing intuition in how gradient descent works, my project allows users to execute gradient descent on a terrain function of the world. Users are able to change the algorithm and variables as well as inspect the path of the algorithm through a graph and an interactive map interface. Project requires a elevation dataset in the form of .hgt files.
